/**
 * Optional CLI runner for a queue worker - the only class coupled to
 * Phalcon\Cli. A thin adapter: it resolves the context from the `queueFactory`
 * service, binds one queue to one processor (both given as command arguments),
 * and runs a Worker whose lifetime bounds come from CLI options. Users not on
 * Phalcon\Cli use Worker directly.
 *
 * Usage:
 *     <task> <queueName> <processorServiceId> \
 *         [--max-messages=N] [--max-time=SECONDS] \
 *         [--max-memory=MB] [--jitter=SECONDS]
 *
 * Register it in your own Phalcon\Cli\Console; it is not auto-wired into
 * FactoryDefault.
